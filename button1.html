            <p>&gt;In 2018, Dougherty called for a ban on “assault weapons” in New Jersey.<br>
                &gt;New Jersey has had an "assault weapon" ban since 1990, it is the second oldest state AWB in the country, only after California and pred<br>
                &gt;When it comes to stricter gun control laws, Dougherty said, “We will push for this until the end.”<br>
                This is why anti-gunners only act in bad faith. This massive gay retard wants to ban something that had at the time already been banned for 28 years and wants a complete gun ban. No compromise, no quarter. For every gun law they pass, we pass 2 anti-abortion and anti-troon laws.

            The Declaration of Independence isn't a legal document, unlike the US Constitution. Now point out where the words 'Commandment', 'Jesus' or 'God' appear in that latter legal document. We'll wait.
